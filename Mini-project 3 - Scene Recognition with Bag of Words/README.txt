Mini-Project # 3 - Scene Recognition with Bag of Words

Overview
--------
In this project, we implement three scene recognition schemes: 
1- Tiny images representation (get_tiny_images()) and nearest neighbor classifier (nearest_neighbor_classify()).
2- Bag of words representation (build_vocabulary(), get_bags_of_words()) and nearest neighbor classifier. 
3- Bag of words representation and linear SVM classifier (svm_classify()).

In this folder, you will find the resulted web page for each 
of the implementation numbered. And, this is the performance
reached for each,

1- Tiny images + NN
Accuracy (mean of diagonal of confusion matrix) is 19.067%

2- BOW + NN
Accuracy (mean of diagonal of confusion matrix) is 59.000%

3- BOW + SVM 
Accuracy (mean of diagonal of confusion matrix) is 70.867% [BEST]
